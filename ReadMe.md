2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Code Structure

- HTML file: `index.html`
- CSS file: `style.css`
- JavaScript file: `script.js`

## How it Works

- The `script.js` file contains code that handles user interactions, such as adding new workouts and displaying them on the map.
- Leaflet.js library is used to create and manage the map, as well as handling map-related events.
- Workout data is stored locally using the browser's localStorage API.
